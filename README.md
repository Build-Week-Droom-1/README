## Architecture 

> Distributed Model-Viewer-Controller (dMVC): seperation of concerns w/ opionioated redundency. 

### Model
> _data store & operations_ simply a postGRES database application for the Controller to call **primative** & **derived** data. 

### Viewer
> _frontend/UI_ a react-app that consumes **controller** information and displays accordingly. 

### Controller 
> _site router & admin_ **mostly heavy lifting** contains and dispatches all server-side actions to **mutate, send, receive, and delete data**.
